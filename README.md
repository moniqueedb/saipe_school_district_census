This project deals with the analysis of SAIPE School District Census data in regards to child poverty populations in United States school districts. We are analyzing the quantity of students in poverty in each school district in relation to the district population and student population of that district. We also look at quantity per region of the U.S and states located in those regions.

This analyses contains a jupyter notebook where the csv USSD1620 was analyzed. This csv file is merged data from the SAIPE school district census data for years 2016-2020. The data was cleaned and additional columns were added to help with further data analysis. To run the jupyter notebook, simply open the file in you local IDE - I used visual studio code - and select run all. Please make sure to have a version of python installed on your device and inside the jupyter notebook we take care of importing the python packages used to analyze the data (Matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy). 

For the power BI dashboard, you can save the .pbix file on your device and make sure to have Power BI desktop installed on your device.
